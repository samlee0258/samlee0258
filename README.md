### Hi there, the name's Sam! ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ’¬ About Me

I am a full-stack Web Developer with an interest in Front End development where I can provide a more pleasant user experience when using web applications. Using front end technologies I strive to make websites not only look great, but have real-world functionality. I am open to connecting and collaborating with like-minded individuals as well as learn new ways to improve my technical skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking and spending time in the gym or the outdoors.
